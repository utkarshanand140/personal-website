abstract: The use of parallel manipulators in aerospace engineering has gained significant attention due to their ability to provide improved stability and precision. This paper presents the design, control, and analysis of 'STEWIE', which is a three-degree-of-freedom (DoF) parallel manipulator robot developed by members of the thrustMIT rocketry team, as a payload stabilization mechanism for their sounding rocket, 'Altair'. The goal of the robot was to demonstrate the attitude control of the parallel plate against the continuous change in orientation experienced by the rocket during its flight, stabilizing the payloads. At the same time, the high gravitational forces (G-forces) and vibrations experienced by the sounding rocket are counteracted. A novel design of the mechanism, inspired by a standard Stewart platform, is proposed which was down-scaled to fit inside a 4U CubeSat within its space constraints. The robot uses three micro servo motors to actuate the links that control the alignment of the parallel plate. In addition to the actuation mechanism, a robust control system for its manipulation was developed for the robot. The robot represents a significant advancement in the field of space robotics in the aerospace industry by demonstrating the successful implementation of complex robotic mechanisms in small, confined spaces such as CubeSats, which are standard form factors for large payloads in the aerospace industry.
