I am a graduate student at RWTH Aachen University, pursuing Masters in Robotics Systems Engineering. I am eager to solve challenging problems in the domain of Robotics especially on the front of Robotics System Design and Controls. 

Before I decided to give up my tools and come back to academia for masters, I was working as an Associate Electrical Systems Engineer at [Strider Robotics, ARTPARK, Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.strider-robotics.in/), where I spent 1.5 years doing system design and embedded firmware programming for quadruped robots. 

I have a background in Electrical Engineering from my undergraduate studies at Manipal Insitute of Technlogy where I was part of their student rocketry team - [thrustMIT](https://www.thrustmit.in/) for two years. Being the  Head of Launch Operations for the team as well as leading the payload team to design a robotic payload stabilization platform, we launched our sounding rocket in the USA in summer of 2023. 

I have previously interned at various reputable institutions like AI & Robotics Technology Park (ARTPARK) - IISc, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, Indian Institue of Science (IISc) Bangalore, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, DRDO etc. and was awarded the prestigious **IASc‐INSA‐NASI Summer Research Fellowship by Indian Academy of Sciences in 2022**.

**If you are interested to inlcude me onto your projects, please contact me on my [email](mailto:utkarshanand221@gmail.com).
